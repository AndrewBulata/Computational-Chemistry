# Computational Chemistry

I have always been fascinated by the concept of "seeing atoms." I recall my mom once telling me when I was around 12 or 13, "how amazing it would be if we could see an atom..." That comment stayed with me, and by the time I was in university, my response was, "we have Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)!" However, when we look at an AFM image, the atoms appear static. The landscape is still, nothing is moving. It falls short of the full picture because it only captures a moment in time. What do atoms do when weâ€™re not observing them? This question drives the motivation behind this section. The feeling that "it doesn't quite cut it" inspires me to play some music and set things in motion.

Here, I have written code to visually simulate the movement of particles under various conditions and assumptions, from ideal gases to real gases, from nuclear fission to black holes. I present my progress on this intricate journey of making atoms move in accordance with the laws of chemistry and physics.

## 1. Phase transition simulation


This Python project simulates phase transitions of Xenon atoms using the Pygame library. The atoms transition between solid, liquid, and gas states as the temperature is adjusted. 

#### Features:
- **Visual Representation**: Displays Xenon atoms in different states with distinct colors.
- **Temperature Control**: Use the up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease the temperature.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Adjusts the movement and state of atoms in real-time based on temperature.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates and displays the entropy of the system using the Shomate equation.

#### Running the Simulation:
To run the simulation, execute the script in PyCharm for a smoother window-closing experience. Make sure to install **pygame**. The simulation window will show atoms in different states based on the temperature you set.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of phase transitions with this interactive simulation!
